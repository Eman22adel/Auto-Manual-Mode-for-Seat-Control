# Auto-Manual-Mode-for-Seat-Control

The purpose of this project is to provide systematic vehicle seat adjustment, allowing users to switch between auto and manual modes for optimal comfort. 

## Project Description

In auto mode, the vehicle seat adjusts based on the following sensors:
- Weight sensor
- Slide sensor
- Height sensor
- Incline sensor

This ensures that the seat position is always optimal for the user's comfort and safety. The application uses the SAAT Spring tool and a mix of other technologies.


## Console Application: SeatCtrlApp Project Overview

This application was created using AppWizard. The main project file is `SeatCtrlApp.vcxproj`, which contains information about the version of Visual C++, the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the Application Wizard.

The filters file is `SeatCtrlApp.vcxproj.filters`, which contains information about the association between the files in your project and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with similar extensions under a specific node.

The main application source file is `SeatCtrlApp.cpp`.

Other standard files include `StdAfx.h` and `StdAfx.cpp`, which are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file named `SeatCtrlApp.pch` and a precompiled types file named `StdAfx.obj`.
